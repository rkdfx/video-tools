# VTools Project Instructions

This project is a React app built with Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS. The goal is to provide a set of tools, starting with a video to GIF converter with presets, progress tracking, and download functionality. Add new tools by creating React components in the `src` directory and integrating them into the main app UI. Work through each checklist item systematically and keep communication concise and focused.
